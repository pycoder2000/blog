Even though I don't use any Apple products myself, it's always nice to see platforms evolve and the user experience improve. Here's the features I hope Apple will announce for iOS and iPadOS at [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22) &mdash; most of these are **unrealistic**, and I don't expect Apple to announce all of them.

- Sideloading apps.
  - While you can sideload apps by self-signing with AltStore, I consider this to be a workaround &mdash; it's meant to be used by developers, so it comes with some limitations, such as a 3 app limit and a 7 day expiry.
  - I doubt Apple would ever implement this by their own choice; they would have to be legally forced by the [Open App Markets Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_App_Markets_Act), the [Digital Markets Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act), or a similar bill.
- RCS support in Messages.
- Auto-unlock on Face ID recognition.
- Interactive widgets.
- Custom app icon packs.
- Dual-boot macOS and iPadOS on M1 iPads.
- Pro tools (Final Cut Pro, Logic, Xcode) on iPadOS.
- Window-mode for iPadOS.
